## Functionalities

## References
  - Modified [Allen Chen's](https://github.com/chenc118/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign3/ExprDiff.hs) method of generalizing the `eval` and `simplify` functions, both located in `ExprEval.hs`. This will allows `ExprEval` to work with numerical types such as `Double`, `Float`, `Integer` and `Int`.
